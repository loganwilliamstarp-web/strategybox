# 🏠 **Self-Hosting Guide - Options Tracker**

## 📊 **Hosting Difficulty Assessment: EASY to MODERATE (6/10)**

Your Options Tracker is **well-designed for self-hosting** with modern deployment practices. Here's the complete analysis:

---

## ✅ **Why Self-Hosting is Relatively Easy**

### **🏗️ Excellent Architecture for Hosting:**
- **✅ Single Node.js application** (frontend + backend combined)
- **✅ Environment-based configuration** (no hardcoded values)
- **✅ Production build script** ready (`npm run build && npm start`)
- **✅ Health check endpoints** for monitoring
- **✅ Graceful error handling** and logging
- **✅ External database** (Supabase - no local DB to manage)

### **📦 Simple Deployment Requirements:**
```bash
# Your app only needs:
✅ Node.js 18+ runtime
✅ Internet connection (for Supabase + APIs)
✅ Environment variables (API keys)
✅ Port 5000 (or configurable via PORT env var)
```

```

### **🌐 Environment Variables Needed:**
```bash
# Required:
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=5000
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://[your-supabase-connection]

# API Keys (from Supabase Vault or direct):
MARKETDATA_API_KEY=[your-key]
FINNHUB_API_KEY=[your-key] 
SESSION_SECRET=[secure-random-string]

# Optional:
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=[your-supabase-url]
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[your-anon-key]
```

### **🔒 Security Considerations:**
```bash
✅ API keys managed via Supabase Vault (secure)
✅ RLS policies applied (data isolation)
