# Schwab API Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Issue: HTTP 500 OAuth Errors

### Problem Summary
Your Schwab API application is fully approved and configured correctly, but Schwab's OAuth endpoint is returning HTTP 500 server errors. This is a known issue affecting multiple developers.

### Root Cause Analysis
✅ **Application Status**: "Ready For Use" - Fully approved
✅ **Credentials**: Valid App Key and Secret configured correctly  
✅ **Callback URL**: Properly set to `https://strangleoptions.com/api/schwab/callback`
✅ **Code Implementation**: OAuth flow correctly implemented

❌ **Schwab's OAuth Service**: Returns HTTP 500 (server-side error)

### Evidence of Server-Side Issue
```bash
# Testing Schwab's OAuth endpoint directly:
curl -I "https://api.schwabapi.com/v1/oauth/authorize?client_id=SG4fsOexcez8X47aEdXlN8UuUHc5qMyXT7tGThzAIIPBJXyk&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fstrangleoptions.com%2Fapi%2Fschwab%2Fcallback&response_type=code&scope=readonly"

# Result: HTTP/2 500 (Server Error)
```

### What We've Confirmed Works
1. **Callback Processing**: Our callback correctly processes authorization codes
2. **Error Handling**: Proper error messages for authentication failures  
3. **Token Management**: Ready to store and refresh tokens once received
4. **URL Generation**: Correct OAuth URLs with valid parameters

### Known Issues from Research
- Multiple developers report similar HTTP 500 errors in 2025
- Schwab has experienced various API outages and service issues
- OAuth service appears to be unstable despite app approval
- Other Schwab services (trading platform, login) also experiencing intermittent issues

### Current Workarounds
1. **Retry Logic**: The app automatically detects HTTP 500 and shows appropriate error messages
2. **Status Monitoring**: Clear indication that this is a server-side issue
3. **Graceful Degradation**: App continues to work with Finnhub data while waiting for Schwab

### What's Ready for When Schwab Fixes Their Service
Once Schwab resolves their OAuth service issues, the following will work immediately:
- ✅ Real-time options chain data
- ✅ Live market premiums for accurate max loss calculations  
- ✅ Professional Greeks (Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega)
- ✅ Volume and open interest data
- ✅ Enhanced position analysis with real market data

### Monitoring & Next Steps
1. **Automatic Testing**: The app tests Schwab's endpoint health on each auth attempt
2. **Error Messages**: Users see clear indication that this is a Schwab server issue
3. **Ready for Recovery**: No code changes needed once Schwab service is restored

### For Users
**What to expect**: "Schwab Service Issue" notification explaining that Schwab's servers are temporarily down but your app is approved and ready.

**When to retry**: Check again in a few hours or the next day, as these are typically temporary outages.

### Timeline
- **Issue Detected**: August 22, 2025
- **Root Cause Identified**: Schwab OAuth endpoint HTTP 500 errors
- **App Status**: Fully ready for live data once Schwab service is restored
